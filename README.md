# What is Killer?
Killer is a game for more than 2 players, it's rules are quite simple. First each person needs to know, who his/her "victim" is. In order to do this players need to write their names on some cards, then shuffle them and give it to each player. Of course, no one should know who your victim is. Then the game begins. If 'killer' and "victim" happen to be face-to-face, in the place, where there are no other people, "killer" can say: "You are murdered", then "victim" loses and his/her victim goes to "killer". This continues until only 2 people are left, and they are winners.
