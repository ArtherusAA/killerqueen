This bot helps you to play Killer.
# What is Killer?
Killer is a game for more than 2 players, it's rules are quite simple. First each person needs to know, who his/her "victim" is. In order to do this players need to write their names on some cards, then shuffle them and give it to each player. Of course, no one should know who your victim is. Then the game begins. If 'killer' and "victim" happen to be face-to-face, in the place, where there are no other people, "killer" can say: "You are murdered", then "victim" loses and his/her victim goes to "killer". This continues until only 2 people are left, and they are winners.
# How this bot simplifies the game process?
There are some problems which can occur while playing. For instance, player can get himself/herself as "victim". But using this bot you can avoid such problems. It automatically sets victims for each player without any collisions, resets victims whem some player gets killed and stops the game when there are only 2 players left. Also this bit counts kills and victories for each player and shows it on the scoreboard.
